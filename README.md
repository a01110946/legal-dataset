# Financial Datasets

Financial Datasets is an open-source Python library 
that allows developers to use Large Language Models (LLMs) 
to create synthetic financial datasets. With this library, 
you can generate realistic financial datasets based on SEC filings 
such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and other financial reports.
